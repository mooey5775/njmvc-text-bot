# NJMVC Text Bot

This bot checks for the elusive NJMVC appointment within a specific date range. Notifications are sent over text.

Thanks to https://github.com/qdbp/mvc-whackamole for their work on a similar system and saving me the work of figuring out how the NJMVC API works.

Twilio is required.
